This is going to be a barebones text adventure game that I can use as a starting template for actual games. Currently it only has the code for moving around, picking up and dropping stuff (also in containers), looking around and two super simple puzzles. Aside from actual descriptions of things, next on the TODO-list is an actual gameloop and a natural language parser for the in-game commands.
