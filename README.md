This is a barebones text adventure game that I can use as a starting template for actual games. You can move around, pick up stuff, drop it (also in containers), look around and solve a couple of simple puzzles. The game has a natural language parser to fetch the commands from the user, so you would typically write tstuff like "go to the cockpit" to play. As this is just barebones, I haven't added any alternative verbs etc.

I used these books in this project:

* W.F. Clocksin and C.S. Mellish, _Programming in Prolog_, New York: Springer-Verlag, 1981.

* Dennis Merrit, _Adventure in Prolog_, New York: Springer-Verlag, 1990.
